		<item>GENERAL PRINCIPLES
			<!--2.1-->%s Role of the FIA
				%c The following technical regulations for Formula One cars are issued by the FIA.
			<!--2.2-->%s Amendments to the regulations
				%c These Technical Regulations apply to the Championship taking place in the calendar year referred to in the title (“the Championship”) and may only be changed after 30 April of the preceding year with the unanimous agreement of all competitors, save for changes made by the FIA for safety reasons which may come into effect without notice or delay.
			<!--2.3-->%s Dangerous construction
				%c The stewards may exclude a vehicle whole construction is deemed to be dangerous.
			<!--2.4-->%s Compliance with the regulations
				%c Automobiles must comply with these regulations in their entirety at all times during an Event.
				%p Should a competitor introduce a new design or system or feel that any aspect of these regulations is unclear, clarification may be sought from the FIA Formula One Technical Department. If clarification relates to any new design or system, correspondence must include:
					%a1 &lt;b&gt;a.&lt;\/b&gt; A full description of the design or system.
					%a1 &lt;b&gt;b.&lt;\/b&gt; Drawings or schematics where appropriate.
					%a1 &lt;b&gt;c.&lt;\/b&gt; The competitor\'s opinion concerning the immediate implications on other parts of the car of any proposed new design.
					%a1 &lt;b&gt;d.&lt;\/b&gt; The competitor\'s opinion concerning any possible long term consequences or new developments which may come from using any such new designs or systems.
					%a1 &lt;b&gt;e.&lt;\/b&gt; The precise way or ways in which the competitor feels the new design or system will enhance the performance of the car.
			<!--2.5-->%s New systems or technologies
				%c Any new system, procedure or technology not specifically covered by these regulations, but which is deemed permissible by the FIA Formula One Technical Department, will only be admitted until the end of the Championship during which it is introduced. Following this the Formula One Commission will be asked to review the technology concerned and, if they feel it adds no value to Formula One in general, it will be specifically prohibited.
				%p Any team whose technology is prohibited in this way will then be required to publish full technical details of the relevant system or procedure.
			<!--2.6-->%s Measurements
				%c All measurements must be made while the car is stationary on a flat horizontal surface.
			<!--2.7-->%s Duty of Competitor
				%c It is the duty of each competitor to satisfy the FIA technical delegate and the stewards that his automobile complies with these regulations in their entirety at all times during an Event.
				%p The design of the car, its components and systems shall, with the exception of safety features, demonstrate their compliance with these regulations by means of physical inspection of hardware or materials. No mechanical design may rely upon software inspection as a means of ensuring its compliance.
				%p Due to their nature, the compliance of electronic systems may be assessed by means of inspection of hardware, software and data.

			<!--3.3-->%s Front wing
				%c &lt;b&gt;3.3.1. Mandatory central section&lt;\/b&gt;
					%p Any vertical section taken parallel to the car centre plane through bodywork located more than 450mm forward of the front wheel centre line, less than 250mm from the car centre plane, and less than 125mm above the reference plane must only contain a single section, which:
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;a.&lt;\/b&gt; Conforms to the profile and incidence defined by the coordinates specified in Drawing 7 (with the exception of local changes of section where the bodywork defined in Article 3.3.2 attaches) with a manufacturing tolerance of +/-0.500mm.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;b.&lt;\/b&gt; Lower trailing edge point, as defined in Drawing 7, is 86.650mm above the reference plane with a manufacturing tolerance of +/-2.000mm.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;c.&lt;\/b&gt; Has its forward most point lying on a curve, when viewed from above, defined by:
							%a2 &lt;b&gt;i.&lt;\/b&gt; A diagonal line from a point 1225mm forward of the front wheel centre line and on the car centre plane to a point 1025mm in front of the front wheel centre line and 1000mm from the car centre plane.
							%a2 &lt;b&gt;ii.&lt;\/b&gt; A 500mm radius tangent to this line and perpendicular to the car centre plane at the car centre plane with its centre less than 1225mm forward of the front wheel centre line. Once the 500mm radius is defined, the diagonal line is trimmed to the intersection point with the radius, retaining the outboard segment.
						%a1 with a manufacturing tolerance of 2.000mm behind this curve only.
					%p The above tolerances are to help overcome any possible manufacturing problems, and not to permit any design which may contravene any part of these regulations.
					%p Furthermore, bodywork in this area may not contain any closed channel the effect of which is to duct air directly or indirectly to or from the external air stream for any purpose other than data acquisition.
				%p &lt;b&gt;3.3.2. Pylons&lt;\/b&gt;

The thickness of each section may not exceed 25mm when measured perpendicular to the car centre plane.
					%p Once fully defined, the sections at 125mm above the reference plane must be projected vertically to join the profile required by Article 3.3.1. A radius no greater than 10mm may be used where these sections join.

						%a1 &lt;b&gt;a.&lt;\/b&gt; A diagonal line from a point 1225mm forward of the front wheel centre line and on the car centre plane to a point 1025mm in front of the front wheel centre line and 1000mm from the car centre plane.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;b.&lt;\/b&gt; A longitudinal line parallel to and 1000mm from the car centre plane.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;c.&lt;\/b&gt; A diagonal line from a point 650mm forward of the front wheel centre line and on the car centre plane to a point 450mm in front of the front wheel centre line and 1000mm from the car centre plane.

					%img2131230866
					%img2131230867
				%p &lt;b&gt;3.3.4. Definition of components&lt;\/b&gt;
					%p On each side of the car, the volume describen in Article 3.3.3 can only contain the following components:
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;a. &lt;\/b&gt; The front wing endplate defined in Article 3.3.5.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;b. &lt;\/b&gt; The front wing profiles defined in Article 3.3.6.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;c. &lt;\/b&gt; A maximum of two front wing strakes as defined in Article 3.3.8.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;d. &lt;\/b&gt; The front wing auxiliary components defined in Article 3.3.9.
				%p &lt;b&gt;3.3.5. Front wing endplate&lt;\/b&gt;
					%p A mathematical surface (referred to as the &lt;i&gt;virtual endplate surface&lt;\/i&gt;) must be constructed in order to subsequently define the endplate.
					%p The virtual endplate surface must:
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;a. &lt;\/b&gt; Lie entirely between 910mm and 950mm from the car centre plane.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;b. &lt;\/b&gt; Extend forwards, rearwards, upwards and downwards in such way as to intersect respectively the forward, rearward, upper and lower bounding surfaces of the volume defined in Article 3.3.3 over its entire length and height.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;c. &lt;\/b&gt; In no place have a normal which subtends an angle greater than 15° to an axis normal to the car centre plane.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;d. &lt;\/b&gt; Produce one single continuous curve, which is entirely visible from side view, when intersected with any lateral vertical or horizontal plane.
					%p The front wing endplate is defined as the bodywork created by the union of two volumes.
					%p The first such volume:
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;e. &lt;\/b&gt; Must fully enclose a minimum of 95% of the virtual endplate surface.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;f. &lt;\/b&gt; Over its forward-most 150mm, measured in the longitudinal direction, must in no part be distant more than 10mm from the virtual endplate surface, while over the rest of its volume must in no part be more than 6mm distant from the virtual endplate surface.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;g. &lt;\/b&gt; Is a single volume which contains no apertures and any intersection with any lateral or horizontal plane may only produce a single closed section.
					%p The second such volume:
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;h. &lt;\/b&gt; Must have no part which is distant more than 30mm from the virtual endplate surface towards the car centre plane. Any part inboard of the virtual endplate surface must lie in its entirety between 75mm and 85mm above the reference plane.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;i. &lt;\/b&gt; Lies in its entirety between 75mm and 110mm from the reference plane.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;j. &lt;\/b&gt; Is a single volume which contains no apertures or slots.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;k. &lt;\/b&gt; When viewed from below, has a boundary which does not contain any external local concave radius of curvature smaller than 200mm.
					%p Once the two volumes have been defined, a fillet radius of up to 5mm will be permitted where they intersect. Any cross section of the unified volume with a lateral vertical plane should contain only a single closed section.
					%p In order to prevent tyre damage to other cars, the complete endplate, with the exception of parts of the second volume inboard of the virtual endplate surface must be at least 10mm thick (being the minimum distance when measured normal to the surface in any direction) with a 5mm radius applied to all extremities.
					%p In addition, the leading 50mm of this bodywork, with the exception of fasteners and inserts as described below, must be of a prescribed laminate, details of this laminate may be found in the Appendix to the Technical Regulations.
					%p Fasteners and related inserts, for the purpose of attaching the front wing endplate to the profiles must be positioned at least 30mm rearward of the leading edge of the endplate.
				%p &lt;b&gt;3.3.6. Front wing profiles&lt;\/b&gt;
					%p Front wing profiles are defined as bodywork that is contained in the volume which extends from 250mm to 950mm from the car centre plane, and within the volume defined in Article 3.3.3. They must meet the following criteria:
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;a. &lt;\/b&gt; Any intersection of these profiles with any longitudinal vertical plane may contain no more than five closed sections, each of which may contain no concave radius of curvature less than 50mm.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;b. &lt;\/b&gt; For the part of the profiles outboard of a plane that lies 400mm from the car centre plane:
							%a2 &lt;b&gt;i. &lt;\/b&gt; The rearmost point of every closed section must be visible when viewed from below.
							%a2 &lt;b&gt;ii. &lt;\/b&gt; With the exception of the rearmost closed section, the rearmost point of every closed section must not be visible when viewed from above.
							%a2 &lt;b&gt;iii. &lt;\/b&gt; The normal to any point of the profiles surface must not subtend an angle greater than 15° to a vertical plane which is normal to the diagonal line described in Article 3.3.3(a).
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;c. &lt;\/b&gt; Outboard of a plane that lies 400mm from the car centre plane the minimum distance between adjacent sections at any longitudinal vertical plane must lie between 5mm and 15mm at their closest position.
					%p Once the rearmost profile has been defined a single &lt;i&gt;gurney&lt;\/i&gt; type trim tab may be fitted to its trailing edge provided no dimension in a vertical longitudinal section exceeds 10mm. This part must comply with the constraints of Article 3.3.6 (b) (iii), with the exception of its innermost and outermost 10mm (measured in a direction normal to the car centre plane) where these constraints do not apply. For clarity, gurneys that overlap with the adjustable and non- adjustable portion of the profiles (as described in Article 3.3.7) will be considered to be a single gurney, provided they satisfy all of the above criteria in the design position of the profiles.
					%p Minimal exceptions to the above geometrical criteria can occur in areas of transition close to consecutive longitudinal vertical cross sections with a different number of individual profiles. Outboard of a longitudinal plane that lies 400mm from the car centre plane, such changes may only be achieved by the bifurcation of a single closed section into two or more closed sections, and the method of construction of this transition is detailed below.
					%p The area of transition will be defined by two vertical planes, which are parallel to each other, up to 20mm apart, and form an angle of no more than 20° to the car centre plane. Within this area:
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;d. &lt;\/b&gt; The inboard (single) profile surface must be defined over the full span of the transition area in full compliance with Article 3.3.6.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;e. &lt;\/b&gt; The outboard profile (two or more) surfaces must be defined over the full span of the transition area in full compliance with Article 3.3.6, lie entirely within the single profile surface, and share the same overall chord.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;f. &lt;\/b&gt; Once the inboard and outboard profile surfaces have been defined, blending surfaces must be defined to join the profiles together. These surfaces must lie within the volume of the single, inboard profile surface, and entirely within the transition volume. Once these minimal transition surfaces have been defined, the original overlapping surfaces of the inboard and outboard profiles must be trimmed accordingly.
					%p The construction method described above may also be used to define the transition outboard of the single section defined by Article 3.3.1 and the sections that lie outboard of it. For the avoidance of doubt, these transition surfaces must lie entirely outboard of a vertical longitudinal plane that lies 250mm from the car centre plane.
					%p Once the front wing profiles have been defined, they must be trimmed by the virtual endplate surface defined in Article 3.3.5, and the portion of the front wing profiles outboard of that surface must be discarded. Where the front wing profiles intersect the front wing endplate, a maximum fillet radius of 10mm may be applied.
				%p &lt;b&gt;3.3.7. Adjusting of front wing&lt;\/b&gt;
					%p Once the Front Wing Profiles have been defined in accordance with Article 3.3.6, a portion of up to four of the rearmost profiles and the gurney, may be adjustable in order to trim the front wing aerodynamic load.
					%p For this purpose:
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;a. &lt;\/b&gt; The parts of the front wing profiles that are included within the adjustable part must have no degrees of freedom between them.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;b. &lt;\/b&gt; The adjustment may only be a rotation about a fixed axis. In plan view, this axis must not subtend an angle greater than 20deg to the diagonal line described in Article 3.3.3 (a), and in front view it must not subtend an angle greater than 15deg to the horizontal plane. For the full extent of the adjustable part of the profiles outboard of a plane that lies 400mm from the car centre plane, and in any longitudinal vertical plane, this axis must lie between two vertical lines, one that passes through the forward most point of the adjustable part of the profiles in that section, and another one 30mm behind the first line.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;c. &lt;\/b&gt; The junction between the adjustable and non-adjustable parts of the profiles must be defined by one or two surfaces of revolution about the fixed axis of rotation defined in 3.3.7 b . Furthermore, any normal to these surfaces of revolution may not subtend an angle greater than 55° to a line that is normal to the car centre plane. These surfaces of revolution must also lie inboard of the virtual endplate surface defined in Article 3.3.5.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;d. &lt;\/b&gt; The original position of these profiles (as defined in accordance with Article 3.3.6) must be included within the overall range of adjustment. Furthermore, the maximum deviation for any point of these profiles between the uppermost and lowermost angle of adjustment must not exceed 35mm.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;e. &lt;\/b&gt; Minimal exceptions to the geometrical criteria of Article 3.3.6 for the wing profiles may be made in the junction between the adjustable and non-adjustable parts, in order to ensure the necessary level of sealing. Such parts must lie within 3mm from one of the two surfaces of revolution and their maximum size must be the minimum necessary amount required to achieve a 20mm overlap between the adjustable and the non-adjustable parts of the profiles over the whole range of movement.
					%p For the avoidance of doubt, the adjustment permitted under this Article is only allowed when the car is stationary and by the use of a tool, and in accordance with the Formula 1 Sporting Regulations.
					%p Furthermore, any such variation of incidence maintains compliance with all of the bodywork regulations, with the exception of Articles 3.3.6 (a) and 3.3.6 (b).
				%p &lt;b&gt;3.3.8. Front wing strakes&lt;\/b&gt;
					%p Strakes may be constructed once the front wing profiles have been defined. For each strake, a virtual strake surface must be first defined, which must:
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;a. &lt;\/b&gt; Be connected to the non-adjustable part of the front wing profiles.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;b. &lt;\/b&gt; Lie in its entirety between two vertical longitudinal planes, 20mm apart, and between 500mm and 800mm from the car centre plane.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;c. &lt;\/b&gt; Lie entirely between 75mm and 150mm from the reference plane.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;d. &lt;\/b&gt; Not be closer than 50mm in any point to the other such virtual strake surface.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;e. &lt;\/b&gt; In no place have a normal which subtends an angle greater than 10° to an axis normal to the car centre plane.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;f. &lt;\/b&gt; Contain no more than one curve when intersected by any lateral vertical or horizontal plane. In side view, no part of the virtual strake surface may obstruct any other part of it.
					%p Once the virtual strake surface has been defined, the strake itself must:
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;g. &lt;\/b&gt; Fully enclose the entire virtual strake surface.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;h. &lt;\/b&gt; In no part lie vertically above the upper surface of the front wing profiles defined in Article 3.3.6.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;i. &lt;\/b&gt; Be no more than 6mm distant from the virtual strake surface, except its rear-most 100mm (measured in the longitudinal direction), where this maximum distance must not exceed 3mm.

				<!--3.6-->%s Rear wing and rear impact structure
					%c &lt;b&gt;3.6.1. Height&lt;\/b&gt;
						%p With the exception of the minimal parts solely associated with adjustment of the rear wing described under 3.6.8, no part of the bodywork behind the rear wheel centre line may be more than 870mm above the reference plane.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.6.2. Width&lt;\/b&gt;
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;a. &lt;\/b&gt; The width of bodywork behind the rear wheel centre line and more than 500mm above the reference plane must not exceed 1050mm.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;b. &lt;\/b&gt; The width of bodywork behind the rear wheel centre line and between 200mm and 500mm above the reference plane must not exceed 840mm.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.6.3. Rear wing profiles&lt;\/b&gt;
						%p Other than the bodywork defined in Article 3.6.6, any bodywork behind the rear wheel centre line which is more than 650mm above the reference plane, and less than 505mm from the car centre plane, must lie in an area when viewed from the side of the car that is situated between 150mm and 500mm rearward of the rear wheel centre line.
						%p With the exception of the bodywork associated with adjustment of the section in accordance with Article 3.6.8:
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;a. &lt;\/b&gt; When viewed from the side of the car, no longitudinal vertical cross section may have more than two sections in this area, each of which must be closed.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;b. &lt;\/b&gt; No part of these longitudinal vertical cross sections in contact with the external air stream may have a local concave radius of curvature smaller than 100mm.
						%p Any bodywork associated with the adjustment of the rearmost section in accordance with Article 3.6.8 must be located either less than 25mm from the longitudinal centre line of the car and less than 900mm above the reference plane or more than 500mm from the longitudinal centre line of the car and less than 870mm above the reference plane.
						%p Once the rearmost and uppermost section is defined, ‘gurney’ type trim tabs may be fitted to the trailing edge. When measured in any longitudinal vertical cross section no dimension of any such trim tab may exceed 20mm.
						%p The chord of the rearmost and uppermost closed section must always be smaller than the chord of the lowermost section at the same lateral station.
						%p Furthermore, the distance between adjacent sections at any longitudinal vertical plane must lie between 10mm and 15mm at their closest position, except, in accordance with Article 3.6.8, when this distance must lie between 10mm and 85mm when the DRS system is deployed.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.6.4. Separators&lt;\/b&gt;
						%p In order to ensure that the individual profiles and the relationship between these two sections can only change whilst the car is in motion in accordance with Article 3.6.8, they must be bridged by means of pairs of rigid impervious supports arranged such that no part of the trailing edge of the forward section may be more than 255mm laterally from a pair of supports. These pairs of supports must:
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;a. &lt;\/b&gt; Be located no more than 505mm from the car centre plane.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;b. &lt;\/b&gt; Fully enclose each complete section such that their inner profiles match that of each section. With the exception of minimal local changes where the two sections are adjacent to each other, their outer profiles must be offset from the inner profiles by between 8mm and 30mm and may not incorporate any radius smaller than 10mm (&lt;i&gt;gurney&lt;\/i&gt; type trim tabs may however be fitted between the supports).
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;c. &lt;\/b&gt; Be aligned as a pair so as to provide a bearing across their full thickness and along a profile length of at least 10mm when the distance between the two sections is at its closest position.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;d. &lt;\/b&gt; Not be recessed into the wing profiles (where a recess is defined as a reduction in section at a rate greater than 45° with respect to a lateral axis).
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;e. &lt;\/b&gt; Be arranged so that any curvature occurs only in a horizontal plane (other than when this bodywork is adjusted in accordance with Article 3.6.8).
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;f. &lt;\/b&gt; Be between 2mm and 5mm thick.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;g. &lt;\/b&gt; Be rigidly fixed to their respective sections.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;h. &lt;\/b&gt; Be constructed from a material with modulus greater than 50GPa.
						%p These supports will be ignored when assessing whether the car is in compliance with Articles 3.6.1, 3.6.3, 3.6.5, 3.6.6 and 3.6.7.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.6.5. Rear impact structure&lt;\/b&gt;
						%p Any parts of the car less than 100mm from the car centre plane and more than 500mm behind the rear wheel centre line must be situated between 200mm and 400mm above the reference plane and no more than 710mm behind the rear wheel centre line.
						%p With the exception of the last 150mm of the tailpipes described in Article 5.8, there must be no bodywork in an area less than 100mm from the car centre plane, more than 200mm behind the rear wheel centre line and between 400mm and 600mm above the reference plane.
						%r5.8,tech20,5,8
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.6.6. Pylons&lt;\/b&gt;
						%p Any horizontal section between 600mm and 650mm above the reference plane, taken through bodywork located rearward of a point lying 50mm forward of the rear wheel centre line and less than 100mm from the car centre plane, may contain no more than two closed symmetrical sections with a maximum total area of 5000mm&#178;. The thickness of each section may not exceed 25mm when measured perpendicular to the car centre plane.
						%p Once fully defined, the section at 645mm above the reference plane may be extruded upwards to join the sections defined in Article 3.6.3. A fillet radius no greater than 10mm may be used where these sections join.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.6.7. Endplates&lt;\/b&gt;
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;a. &lt;\/b&gt; In side view, the projected area of any bodywork lying between 300mm and 870mm above the reference plane and between the rear wheel centre line and a point 810mm behind it and more than 400mm from the car centre plane must be greater than 280,000mm&#178;.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;b. &lt;\/b&gt; Any bodywork behind the rear wheel centre line, more than 100mm from the car centre plane, and between 200mm and 650mm above the reference plane must lie in an area more than 400mm from the car centre plane. On any horizontal section through the bodywork in this area, at any given longitudinal position along this section, the distance between the inner and outer surfaces must not exceed 20mm measured perpendicular to the car centre line.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;c. &lt;\/b&gt; In side view, no bodywork rearward of the rear wheel centre line, and between 100mm and 525mm from the car centre plane, may be situated vertically above a diagonal line which has the forward point 370mm above the reference plane and on the rear wheel centre line and the rearward point 870mm above the reference plane and 190mm rearward of the rear wheel centre line.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;d. &lt;\/b&gt; In side view, no bodywork rearward of the rear wheel centre line, and between 100mm and 525mm from the car centre plane, may be situated rearward of a diagonal line which has the forward point 200mm above the reference plane and 550mm rearward of the rear wheel centre line and the rearward point 870mm above the reference plane and 810mm rearward of the rear wheel centre line.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;e. &lt;\/b&gt; In an area lying behind the rear wheel centre line, more than 100mm from the car centre plane, and more than 600mm above the reference plane, any intersection of any bodywork visible from the side of the car with a horizontal or lateral vertical plane must form one continuous line which is visible from the side of the car.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.6.8. Drag reduction system (DRS)&lt;\/b&gt;
						%p The incidence of the rearmost and uppermost closed section described in Article 3.6.3 may be varied whilst the car is in motion provided:
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;a. &lt;\/b&gt; It comprises only one component that must be symmetrically arranged about the car centre plane with a minimum width of 1008mm.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;b. &lt;\/b&gt; With the exception of minimal parts solely associated with adjustment of the section, no parts of the section in contact with the external airstream may be located any more than 505mm from the car centre plane.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;c. &lt;\/b&gt; With the exception of any minimal parts solely associated with adjustment of the rearmost and uppermost section, two closed sections are used in the area described in Article 3.6.3.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;d. &lt;\/b&gt; Any such variation of incidence maintains compliance with all of the bodywork regulations.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;e. &lt;\/b&gt; It cannot be used to change the geometry of any duct, either directly or indirectly, other than the change to the distance between adjacent sections permitted by Article 3.6.3..
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;f. &lt;\/b&gt; When viewed from the side of the car at any longitudinal vertical cross section, the physical point of rotation of the rearmost and uppermost closed section must be fixed and located no more than 20mm below the upper extremity and no more than 20mm forward of the rear extremity of the combined areas described in Articles 3.6.1 and 3.6.3 at all times.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;g. &lt;\/b&gt; The design is such that failure of the system will result in the uppermost closed section returning to the normal high incidence position.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;h. &lt;\/b&gt; Any alteration of the incidence of the uppermost closed section may only be commanded by direct driver input and controlled using the control electronics specified in Article 8.2.

					%c Compliance with this Article must be demonstrated with all unsprung parts of the car removed.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.7.1. Step and reference planes&lt;\/b&gt;
						%p With the parts referred to in Articles 3.7.10, 3.7.11 and 3.7.12 removed all sprung parts of the car situated from 430mm behind the front wheel centre line to 175mm in front of the rear wheel centre line, and which are visible from underneath, must form surfaces which lie on one of two parallel planes, the reference plane or the step plane.
						%p The step plane must be 50mm above the reference plane.
						%p Additionally, the surface formed by all parts lying on the reference plane must:
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;a. &lt;\/b&gt;Cover the area which is bounded by two transversal lines, one 430mm behind the front wheel centre line and the other on the rear wheel centre line, and two longitudinal lines 150mm either side of the car centre plane.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;b. &lt;\/b&gt;Have a maximum width of 500mm.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;c. &lt;\/b&gt;Be symmetrical about the car centre plane.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;d. &lt;\/b&gt;Have a 50mm radius (+\/-2mm) on each front corner when viewed from directly beneath the car, this being applied after the surface has been defined.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.7.2. Transition&lt;\/b&gt;
						%p The surface lying on the reference plane must be joined around its periphery to the surfaces lying on the step plane by a vertical transition. If there is no surface visible on the step plane vertically above any point around the periphery of the reference plane, this transition is not necessary.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.7.3. Boundaries&lt;\/b&gt;
						%pThe surface lying on the reference plane may be curved upwards at its boundaries with an arc of constant curvature whose radius of curvature is no greater than 25mm, with no inflection, which is tangential to the surface and applied perpendicular to the boundary. In no case may the arc start further than 25mm from the boundary (when measured on the surface and perpendicular to this boundary).
						%pWhere the vertical transition meets the surfaces on the step plane a radius no greater than 25mm is permitted (a radius in this context will be considered as an arc of constant curvature applied perpendicular to the boundary and tangential to both surfaces).
						%pThe surfaces lying on the step plane which do not meet one of the vertical transitions may be curved upwards at their boundaries with an arc whose radius of curvature is no greater than 100mm at any point, with no inflection, which is tangential to the surface and applied perpendicular to the boundary. In no case may the arc start further than 100mm from the boundary (when measured on the surface and perpendicular to this boundary).
						%pThe surface lying on the reference plane, the surfaces lying on the step plane, the vertical transitions between them and any surfaces rearward of the surfaces lying on the reference or step planes, must first be fully defined before any radius can be applied or the parts referred to in Articles 3.7.10, 3.7.11 and 3.7.12 fitted. Any radius applied is still considered part of the relevant surface.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.7.4. Floor construction&lt;\/b&gt;
						%pAll parts lying on the reference and step planes, in addition to the transition between the two planes, must produce uniform, solid, hard, continuous, rigid (no degree of freedom in relation to the unit comprising the survival cell/power unit/gearbox), impervious surfaces under all circumstances.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.7.5. Tolerances&lt;\/b&gt;
						%pTo help overcome any possible manufacturing problems, and not to permit any design which may contravene any part of these regulations, the following dimensional tolerances are permitted on bodywork situated between 430mm behind the front wheel centre line and the rear wheel centre line: a vertical tolerance of +\/- 3mm is permissible across the surfaces lying on the reference and step planes and a horizontal tolerance of 3mm is permitted when assessing whether a surface is visible from beneath the car.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.7.6. Diffuser width&lt;\/b&gt;
						%pThe width of bodywork behind the rear wheel centre line and less than 200mm above the reference plane must not exceed 1050mm.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.7.7. Diffuser length&lt;\/b&gt;
						%pNo part of the car between 100mm and 525mm from the car centre plane and less than 200mm above the reference plane may be more than 350mm behind the rear wheel centre line.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.7.8. Diffuser height and construction&lt;\/b&gt;
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;a. &lt;\/b&gt;No bodywork which is visible from beneath the car which lies between 175mm forward of the rear wheel centre line and 350mm rearward of the rear wheel centre line and is less than 450mm above the reference plane may be more than 175mm above the reference plane.
						%a1Additionally, any bodywork in this area must produce uniform, solid, hard, continuous (no fully enclosed holes), rigid (no degree of freedom in relation to the unit comprising the survival cell\/power unit\/gearbox), impervious surfaces under all circumstances.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;b. &lt;\/b&gt;All sprung parts of the car situated behind a line 175mm in front of the rear wheel centre line, which are visible from underneath and are more than 250mm from the car centre plane, must be at least 50mm above the reference plane.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.7.9. Continuity&lt;\/b&gt;
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;a. &lt;\/b&gt;In an area lying 450mm or less from the car centre plane, and from 450mm forward of the plane C-C to 350mm rearward of the rear wheel centre line, any intersection of any bodywork visible from beneath the car with a lateral or longitudinal vertical plane should form one continuous line which is visible from beneath the car.
						%a1 &lt;b&gt;b. &lt;\/b&gt;In an area lying 700mm or less from the car centre plane, and from 450mm forward of the plane C-C to 350mm forward of the rear wheel centre line, any intersection of any bodywork visible from beneath the car with a lateral or longitudinal vertical plane should form one continuous line which is visible from beneath the car.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.7.10. Plank&lt;\/b&gt;
						%pBeneath the surface formed by all parts lying on the reference plane, a rectangular plank, with a 50mm radius (+\/-2mm) on each front corner, must be fitted. This plank may comprise no more than three pieces, the forward one of which may not be any less than 900mm in length, but must:
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;a. &lt;\/b&gt;Extend longitudinally from a point lying 430mm behind the front wheel centre line to the rear wheel centre line.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;b. &lt;\/b&gt;Have a width of 300mm with a tolerance of +\/- 2mm.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;c. &lt;\/b&gt;Be made from an homogeneous material with a specific gravity between 1.3 and 1.45, or if pocketed be made from a bonded assembly the upper 0.5mm of which must have a specific gravity of between 1.3 and 1.65 and the remainder, excluding pockets, be made from an homogeneous material with a specific gravity of between 1.3 and 1.45.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;d. &lt;\/b&gt;Have a thickness of 10mm with a tolerance of +\/-1mm.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;e. &lt;\/b&gt;Have a uniform thickness when new.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;f. &lt;\/b&gt;With the exception of the area lying between 400mm and 800mm forward of the plane C-C, pocketing of the lower 9.5mm of the plank from above is permitted more than 630mm behind the front wheel centre line. However, the pocket depth may not reduce the remaining plank material thickness to less than 2mm from either the lowest surface below the reference plane when new or the lower surface of any recesses necessary to fit the skids permitted by Article 3.7.11. Furthermore, the periphery of any pocket, in any horizontal plane parallel to the reference plane, must be not less than 10mm from either the edges of the plank or any holes or recesses in the plank. In vertical cross section the internal pocket fillet radii must be at least 3mm and in horizontal cross section 10mm. Pockets may only be filled with a material having a specific gravity of less than 0.25.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;g. &lt;\/b&gt;Have no other holes or cut outs other than those necessary to fit the skids permitted by Article 3.7.11 or the fasteners permitted by Article 3.7.12, or those holes specifically mentioned in h) below.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;h. &lt;\/b&gt;Have seven precisely placed holes the positions of which are detailed in Drawing 1. In order to establish the conformity of the plank assembly after use, its thickness will only be measured in the four 50mm diameter holes and the two forward 80mm diameter holes, regardless of whether plank or skid material is present (see Article 3.7.11(a)).
							%a1 Four further 10mm diameter holes are permitted provided their sole purpose is to allow access to the bolts which secure the Accident Data Recorder to the survival cell.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;i. &lt;\/b&gt;Be fixed symmetrically about the car centre plane in such a way that no air may pass between the complete plank assembly and the surface formed by the parts lying on the reference plane.
						%pThe lower edge of the periphery of the plank may be chamfered at an angle of 30° to a depth of 8mm, the trailing edge however may be chamfered over a distance of 200mm to a depth of 8mm.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.7.11. Skids&lt;\/b&gt;
						%pThe lower surface of the plank may be fitted with flush mounted metal skids which:
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;a. &lt;\/b&gt;May only be fitted in place of plank material.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;b. &lt;\/b&gt;Have a total area no greater than 20000mm&#178; when viewed from directly beneath the car.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;c. &lt;\/b&gt;Are no greater than 4000mm&#178; in area individually when viewed from directly beneath the car.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;d. &lt;\/b&gt;Are fitted in order that their entire lower surfaces are visible from directly beneath the car.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;e. &lt;\/b&gt;Must have a minimum cross sectional thickness of 15mm across its external boundaries in plan view.
							%a1The minimum wall thickness between an internal fixing hole and the external boundaries of the skid must be no less than 7.5mm.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;f. &lt;\/b&gt;Must have an upper surface no more than 3mm below the reference plane.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;g. &lt;\/b&gt;Must be designed such that they are secured to the car using the fasteners described in Article 3.7.12 and that, when viewed from directly beneath the car, no part of the skid is more than 50mm from the centre line of a fastener which passes through that skid.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;h. &lt;\/b&gt;Must be made from Titanium alloy.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.7.12. Plank and skids mounting&lt;\/b&gt;
						%pThe plank and skids must be fixed to the car using fasteners which:
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;a. &lt;\/b&gt;Are no smaller than M6 and are made from grade 12.9 steel.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;b. &lt;\/b&gt;If used to attach a skid to the car, must employ at least 1 fastener per 1,000mm&#178; of skid area.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;c. &lt;\/b&gt;If used to attach a skid to the car, the team must be able to show by calculation that the shanks of the fasteners (which may be no less than 6mm diameter) are the weakest point in the attachment of the skids to the car.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;d. &lt;\/b&gt;May use a load spreading washer if required.
						%pThe total area of the fasteners and any load spreading washers employed with them when viewed from directly beneath the car must be less than 7,500mm&#178;. The area of any single fastener plus its load-spreading washer may not exceed 500mm&#178;.
						%pNo part of any fastener or load-spreading washer may be more than 8mm below the reference plane. For the avoidance of doubt, the skids referred to in Article 3.7.11 will not be treated as load spreading washers.

					%p &lt;b&gt;3.9.4.&lt;\/b&gt; Bodywork may deflect no more than 3mm vertically when a 500N load is applied simultaneously to each side of it 250mm behind the rear wheel centre line, 375mm from the car centre plane and 890mm above the reference plane. The deflection will be measured at the outer extremities of the bodywork at a point 395mm behind the rear wheel centre line.
						%pThe load will be applied in a downward direction through pads measuring 200mm x 100mm which conform to the shape of the bodywork beneath them, and with their uppermost horizontal surface 890mm above the reference plane. The load will be applied to the centre of area of the pads. Teams must supply the latter when such a test is deemed necessary.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.9.5.&lt;\/b&gt; Bodywork may deflect no more than 5mm vertically when a 4000N load is applied vertically to it at three different points which lie on the car centre plane and 100mm either side of it. Each of these loads will be applied in an upward direction at a point 480mm rearward of the front wheel centre line using a 50mm diameter ram in the two outer locations and a 70mm diameter ram on the car centre plane.
						%pStays or structures between the front of the bodywork lying on the reference plane and the survival cell may be present for this test, provided they are completely rigid and have no system or mechanism which allows non-linear deflection during any part of the test.
						%pFurthermore, the bodywork being tested in this area may not include any component which is capable of allowing more than the permitted amount of deflection under the test load (including any linear deflection above the test load), such components could include, but are not limited to:
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;a. &lt;\/b&gt;Joints, bearings pivots or any other form of articulation.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;b. &lt;\/b&gt;Dampers, hydraulics or any form of time dependent component or structure.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;c. &lt;\/b&gt;Buckling members or any component or design which may have any non-linear characteristics.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;d. &lt;\/b&gt;Any parts which may systematically or routinely exhibit permanent deformation.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.9.6.&lt;\/b&gt; The uppermost aerofoil element lying behind the rear wheel centre line may deflect no more than 7mm horizontally when a 500N load is applied horizontally. The load will be applied 870mm above the reference plane at three separate points which lie on the car centre plane and 270mm either side of it. The loads will be applied in a rearward direction using a suitable 25mm wide adapter which must be supplied by the relevant team.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.9.7.&lt;\/b&gt; The forward-most aerofoil element lying behind the rear wheel centre line and which lies more than 630mm above the reference plane may deflect no more than 2mm vertically when a 200N load is applied vertically. The load will be applied in line with the trailing edge of the element at any point across its width.
						%pThe loads will be applied using a suitable adapter, supplied by the relevant team, which:
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;a. &lt;\/b&gt;May be no more than 50mm wide.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;b. &lt;\/b&gt;Which extends no more than 10mm forward of the trailing edge.
							%a1 &lt;b&gt;c. &lt;\/b&gt;Incorporates an 8mm female thread in the underside.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.9.8.&lt;\/b&gt;Any part of the trailing edge of any front wing flap may deflect no more than 5mm, when measured along the loading axis, when a 60N point load is applied normal to the flap.
					%p &lt;b&gt;3.9.9.&lt;\/b&gt;In order to ensure that the requirements of Article 3.8 are respected, the FIA reserves the right to introduce further load/deflection tests on any part of the bodywork which appears to be (or is suspected of), moving whilst the car is in motion.

		<!--3.10-->%s Bodywork construction
					%c &lt;b&gt;3.10.1.&lt;\/b&gt; In order to avoid the spread of debris on the track following an accident, the outer skins of the front wing endplates and any turning vanes in the vicinity of the front wheels (and any similarly vulnerable bodywork parts in this area), must be made predominantly from materials which are included for the specific purpose of containing debris.
					%p The FIA must be satisfied that all such parts are constructed in order to achieve the stated objective.
